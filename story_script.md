# FUNKY PACK #

Dynny: and that's that

well, accidents happen, but I actually told you that it was expensive...

DYNNY: I can pay your debt if you want.

DYNNY: No, I'm good. The thing is... what can I do to get all this money? Health is just for wealthy ones or what?

NUKKO: Well, guess you'll need to work. harder than ever before.

NUKKO: debts aren't gonna pay by themselves, so You'll need to work to pay them all.

NUKKO: I saw some jobs in the newspaper so you can apply for some... or find some people that want your help. I heard that the pavan needs a guy to deliver the newspaper at 4am. if you want, I can call him.

DYNNY: thanks nukko.

WEALTHY BADGER: new in town? this isn't new

WEALTHY BADGER: I wanna know how lonely you can get if you don't have any families in here.

WEALTHY BADGER: Well, you have nukko, so... you're not that alone.

WEALTHY BADGER: my family is just off there because they're evading taxes. I'm just here because I like living here.

I don't need them because I have my maids and you.

I love you, Dynny...

Don't get me wrong... I'm not gay, I like you platonically.

You'll continue receiving your salary. I'm rich. You won't be punished.

You'll be more than my driver. you'll be my member. In this world, dad always said to me that, you need to firm connections with others in order to grow. you don't need to like or chat with them like in a bar. just having his simple contact can give you power to do anything you wish. And I want you to have that.

I heard that if you know the right people they'll quit your debt.

WEALTHY BADGER: It's not dignity if you work more than everyone, like I don't even work. You work about 4 different jobs and all just to pay off a debt from a thing that wasn't even that serious.



the crystal is beautiful.

I'm not here for nothing, let's go Dynny.

WEALTHY BADGER: My dad says that we cannot go to airport in debt. but he actually is referring that if anything you'll need a private jet.

WEALTHY BADGER: The street of same houses? kinda gross, but unification is key.

Is this your house? Looks small, but it may be pretty comfy.

dad always tells me that gross people lives in trailers, but Nukko is so cute I'm not sure that it's true.

Nukko eats you? can he eat me too?
wow Dynny, your friend's belly is so comfy. I could be here forever...

can I get eaten by you?
comfy as always. i could make you my sleep sack 

like what? saving the world? this isn't gonna happen, actually they don't care much about anything related to that. it's the 21st century and no one actually care if aliens are real or not.
I don't know why your family abandoned you, you're such a chill guy.

I know this guy!
