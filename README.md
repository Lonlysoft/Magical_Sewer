# Magical_Sewer
A browser game about an anthropomorphic raccoon trying to escape an underground sewer.

This game is a top down game, it uses the canvas library and functions to draw graphics in screen.

unfortunately, the methods of trying to make the game in potrait mode gave me a headache, and initaially it wasn't planned to have a portrait mode, so I just used the CSS @media property to warn the user to turn the device to landscape

it's in a very initial state. the things that are do done is the map drawing and scrolling methods, I had tried the drawing tiles. but I prefer handling collisions first rather than finalize the tile design.

most of the font used in the game is the "classic comic w01 regular" I used this to match the artstyle of the Cartoon Town Style.
